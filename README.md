Heisprosjekt

School project that controls 4 different elevators (all operating in the same building). Elevators can get commands from the outside (come-here-calls) and from the inside (go-there-calls). The code is designed to ensure that a command is carried out, even if one or more elevators  goes down. It is also optimized to choose the right elevator for the right command
